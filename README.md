# lpd8-web-editor

This is a Preact-based editor for the AKAI LPD8 USB Midi controller. This allows you to edit the MIDI notes/CC numbers that the devices uses when hitting pads/moving knobs. 

It's currently (2022) hosted at https://lpd8.bngf.space/. This repository is primarily meant to be a backup and archive of the code. If someone feels like improving things, I'm most likely open to accept PRs â€“ let's discuss this when it comes up.

It's in no way affiliated to AKAI.
